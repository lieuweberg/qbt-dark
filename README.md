# qbt-dark

![](https://f.lieuweberg.com/luTcLD.png)

Fork of [jagannatharjun/qbt-theme](https://github.com/jagannatharjun/qbt-theme), but without the new icons.

This fork also changes the building process since I only care about a single theme (and couldn't get argparser to work), **mumble-dark**.
